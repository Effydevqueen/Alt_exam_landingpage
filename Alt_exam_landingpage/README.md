#Here ar e the steps i took to set up an Ubuntu Web Server with Apache and SSL on AWS

## Step 1: Log in to AWS
First, I logged into my AWS Console using my IAM user credentials.

---

## Step 2: Launch an EC2 Instance
- I launched an Ubuntu t2.micro instance.
- Created a new key pair.
- Configured the security group inbound rules to allow:
  - **Port 22** ssh from my ip
  - **Port 80** http from anywhere
  - **Port 443** https from anywhere

---

## Step 3: Connect to the Instance
Using my terminal, I connected to the instance with SSH.

1. Navigated to the folder where my downloaded key pair was saved.
2. Used this command:
  %   ssh -i "Alt_exam@semester@.pem" ubuntu@ec2-3-85-231-215.compute-1.amazonaws.com

 ![ssh connection](./img/sshconnection.png)

## Next is to Update and Upgrade the Instance
i was Logged in as Ubuntu user, then switched to the root user:

 %   sudo su

 %   Apt update 

Upgrade the Instance for recent versions

 %    Apt upgrade -y
 ![Instance update](./img/instanceupdat.png)

## Step 5: Install Apache
Installed the Apache2 web server:

 % apt install apache2
 ![APache insatall](./img/installapache.png)

 ## Step 6: Start and Enable Apache
After installing Apache2 we need to enable it and then check the status.

 %  systemctl start apache2
 %  systemctl enable apache2


 ![APache status](./img/Apachestatus.png) 

 we can see our server is running and active

you can also confirm by going to your aws to copy your public ipv4 address and pasting it on a browser.

make sure you change the protocol to http else you'll get an error.

e.g  [http://3.85.231.215/] not (https://3.85.231.215/) 


if everything is done right you should see something like this.

## step 7:Replace Default Index.html
run the following command below.

Navigavte to the html directory
%  cd /var/www/html 

list file 
% ls  

Edit the index.html file
% vi index.html

paste the content of your own web page in this index.html file or simply delete and create your own index.html

## Step 8: Create a Domain
Registered a free domain using afraid.dns.

and configureed my public ipv4 address to my registred domain




## Step 9: Install Certbot for SSL

run the following command
%  sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache -y

![certbot installation](./img/certbotinstall.png)

% sudo cerbot --apache

follow the prompt and enter email 

![certbotapache ](./img/certbot%20apache.png)




## Step 11: Verify SSL Assignment

Tested to ensure SSL was correctly assigned to my domain.

![ssl-certificate](./img/ssl-certificate.png)


After completeing the steps 

Apache was running with my  custom  index.html landing page.
SSL was successfully installed and verified.
My web server was accessible via the custom domain at https://web.elizabetheziefule.mooo.com/.
